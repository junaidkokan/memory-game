## How to play
It is a browser based card matching game. The gameplay is very simple. You turn over one tile and try to find a matching tile from the remaining hidden tiles. If you select matching tiles, they remain open. Otherwise they close after briefly revealing the pattern behind.The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched
